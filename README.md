## Requirements

SE candidates will be required to build and deliver a simple program.  You can use any programming language(s) but Javascript and/or Python are preferred.

Candidates should fork this repo to deliver their project.

## Instructions

Create a [Rapid API](https://rapidapi.com) account and write a program that gets data from a REST endpoint and writes it somewhere else.

Note - You don't necessarily have to use Rapid API - it can be any API endpoint.  Feel free to get creative.

Example: *Use the Yahoo Finance `GET market/v2/get-movers` API endpoint to retrieve the top stock movers and write them (in easily readable format) to a local .txt document.*
