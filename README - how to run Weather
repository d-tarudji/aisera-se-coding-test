// This README file is to provide info on how run weather.js with the intent 
// gets data from a REST endpoint and writes it somewhere else (i.e. text file, weather_report) 

The weather.js run on a local machine, a laptop.
Create a folder, on a local machine. let's called it weatherRun.  In the folder run "command npm init", like the following:
    bash-3.2$ npm init.
inside the weatherRun directory, create a file weather.js with the weather.js code shown in this github.
Once completed, then run "node weather.js" from the cmd line as follow:
    bash-3.2$ node weather.js
it would then produce a file called weather_report.txt like the following:
   bash-3.2$ node weather.js 
   ✅ Weather report saved to weather_report.txt
The output can be viewed by cmd: cat weather_report.txt
      bash-3.2$ cat weather_report.txt
